# CleanCity Project - Test Summary & Lessons Learned

## 📌 Overview
This project involved requirement analysis, test design, manual testing, defect logging, and automation testing for the CleanCity Waste Scheduler application.  
Our testing activities focused on validating major functionalities such as user registration, authentication, and scheduling.

---

## ✅ Testing Activities Completed

### ✔ Manual Testing (Jira)
- All test cases were created in Jira based on the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
- Test execution was logged in Jira and linked to user stories and epics.
- Failed test cases automatically generated Bug tickets.

### ✔ Automation Testing (Selenium)
- Login and Registration flows were automated using Selenium WebDriver.
- Automation validated repeated test cycles more efficiently.

### ✔ Defect Tracking
- Bugs were logged as `Bug` issue types in Jira.
- Bugs were linked to Test Cases, Test Executions, and User Stories.

## 🚧 Major Challenges & How We Solved Them

### 1. High Knowledge Demand
- Struggled to transition from theory to real implementation.
- **Solution:** Used YouTube, documentation, PLP materials.

### 2. Setup & Configuration Issues
- Tools behaved inconsistently on different laptops.
- **Solution:** Standardized configuration and shared setup guides via GitHub.

### 3. Coordination Flow Issues
- Sometimes task ownership was unclear.
- **Solution:** Used Jira assignments and daily sync meetings.
